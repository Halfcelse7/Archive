  <string key="AboutVG">
    <value>Your role is simple - try to survive. Each day, you will have a chance to lynch the werewolf.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSeer">
    <value>You are the Seer. Each night, you may choose a player, and have their role revealed to you. Admit to your role wisely: If you reveal you are the seer, the wolves will try to kill you!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutWw">
    <value>You get to have fun! Each day, you will attempt to decieve your fellow players. However, each night, you will get to pick a player to kill!\nNote: If you attack the cursed, they will become a wolf like yourself! Hooray friends!\nIf you attack the drunk, you yourself will become drunk, and will be unable to do the next attack as you sleep off your hangover! (Usually, this means you can't attack the following night, but if the Wolf Cub was killed and the Drunk was your first choice, you won't be able to kill the second player, and you will still be able to attack the following night.)</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutHarlot">
    <value>As the harlot (you slut...) you will be given the chance to 'visit' another player each night. If they are not the wolf, you will be told so (because you live!). If you visit a wolf, you will be killed. If you visit the player the wolves have chosen to kill, you will be killed as well. However - If you are visiting a player, and the wolves choose to kill you, you will survive (you weren't home)</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDrunk">
    <value>You drunken bastard! As the drunk, you are still just a villager. BUT! If the wolves kill you, they will become disabled for the next kill, as they are drunk off your insanely high BAC.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCursed">
    <value>As the cursed, you are a normal villager... until the wolves kill you. Once they do, you will become a wolf as well! Free to hunt in the night... XD</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutTraitor">
    <value>You are a traitorous bastard. If you survive long enough for all the wolves to die, you will become a werewolf, ready to kill your former teammates in the night!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutGA">
    <value>You are the Guardian Angel! Each night, you may choose a player to watch over. Be careful however - if you choose to watch over a wolf, there is a 50% chance you will be killed.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDetective">
    <value>You old sleuth. Each day, you will have the chance to investigate another player. Use this carefully however, for these is a 40% chance the werewolves will detect you!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutGunner">
    <value>A bit trigger happy are we? As the gunner, you are given 2 silver bullets at the beginning of the game. Each day, you will have the chance to shoot another player. Once you do, everyone will know you are the gunner! Be careful though, you only have 2 bullets!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutTanner">
    <value>The Tanners goal is simple: Get Lynched. If the Tanner gets lynched, they win, period. Everyone else loses.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutFool">
    <value>The fool is told they are the seer.... when they choose to see someone's role at night, they are told a random role.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCult">
    <value>As a cultist, it is your goal to convert all other players (except wolves) to your cult. If at the end of the game, all living players are cultist - the cult wins</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCH">
    <value>Your job is to hunt the Cult. If the cult attacks you, their newest member will die. Each night you may pick a player to 'hunt' - if they are a cultist, they will die.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutWC">
    <value>At the beginning of the game, you will choose someone to be your 'role model'. If they die, you become a werewolf.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutAppS">
    <value>For now, you are a normal villager. However, if the seer dies, you will become the new seer</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutBH">
    <value>You will be told who the seer is (the real one, not the fool)</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutMason">
    <value>A mason's job is simple - they automatically know who the other masons are. Otherwise, they are a simple villager.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDG">
    <value>Your ancestors had the ability to metamorph into others... while you don't have their full abilities, you can pick a player at the start of the game. If that player dies, you will become what they were. Note: If the player was converted to cult, you will take on their original role. All other normal rules apply: If they were Wild Child and their role model died, you will become a wolf. Otherwise, you will inherit their role model. The cult cannot convert the Doppelgänger (but can after the doppelganger switches roles). Also - the Doppelgänger can NOT win unless they have transformed. If at the end of the game, the Doppelgänger is still the same, they lose (exception: lover)</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCupid">
    <value>Love is in the air. As Cupid, you will choose two players at the start of the game. These two players will become madly in love! If one of them dies, the other will die of sorrow :( Note: Lovers will know who each other are, but not be told their roles. If the lovers are the last two alive, they win, regardless of teams. If the lovers are on different teams (villager + wolf), and one team wins (wolf), the lover (villager) wins as well. TL;DR if at least one of the lovers was on the winning team, they both win together.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutHunter">
    <value>A trigger happy, vindictive player. As the hunter, you try to keep to yourself. However, when others come to visit you, they may find themselves dead, as your paranoia takes hold and you shoot. If the wolves attack you, you have a chance to take one of them with you. Otherwise, if you die, you will get a chance to shoot someone as you die. Note: For wolf attacks, the chance starts at 30%. If there is one wolf, the hunter has a 30% chance to kill the wolf (and survive). For each additional wolf, add 20% (2 wolves = 50%, 3 = 70%, etc). However - if there are multiple wolves, while you may kill one of them, you will still be outnumbered and killed. If the cult tries to convert you, they have a 50% chance to fail. If they fail, you have a 50% chance to kill one of them!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSK">
    <value>That asylum was silly anyways. What a joke. You are free now however, back to business as usual - killing! The serial killer is a lone player, on their own team. They can win only if they are the last player alive (exception: lovers). As the serial killer, you can kill ANYONE - wolves, hunters, gunners, guardian angels, whatever. If the wolves try to attack you, you will kill one of them (random), and live.</value>

    <value>You are the Mayor 🎖. Your vote during the lynching will count twice, once you have revealed yourself. You are on the village team.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoPrince">
    <value>You are secretly the Prince 👑, escaping from your boring, pampered life by spending the day with these peasants. If they try to lynch you, they realize their error, and no one will be lynched.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoClumsyGuy">
    <value>You are the Clumsy Guy 🤕: You’ll try to vote, but there is a 50% chance you’ll vote for someone else other than you intended instead. You’re still on the village team though.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoSorcerer">
    <value>You are the Sorcerer 🔮, allying yourself with creatures of the night rather than villagers. At night you will use your power to find the wolves or the Seer. You win only if the wolves win. Enjoy helping snuff out those miserable villagers.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoBlacksmith">
    <value>You are the Blacksmith ⚒: the metalworker of the village. You have a small amount of silver, enough to prevent the wolves from attacking for one night. During the day, you can choose to powder it and spread it around the village. Other than that, you are just a villager.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoAlphaWolf">
    <value>You are the Alpha Wolf ⚡️; the source of the scourge. Your bite is the cause of the curse that turns humans into werewolves. Each night, you will choose a human to attack and kill, but as long as you are alive, your victim has a 20% chance of turning into a werewolf.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoWolfCub">
    <value>You are the Wolf Cub 🐶; adored by your wolf pack. Like other wolves, you will choose a villager to attack and kill every night. If you happen to be killed, your wolf pack will fly into a rage and attack two people the next night. You’ll still be dead though.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="PrinceLynched">
    <value>As the village begins to lynch {0}, they say “Wait! I am the Prince. This royal ring, with the seal of the king proves it. Every night I am surrounded by servants. So I cannot be evil.” Feeling foolish, the villagers sheepishly retire for the night.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="MayorReveal">
    <value>{0} steps forward and presents the official seal of the Mayor, declaring themselves as such. From now on, {0}'s votes for lynching will count twice.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AskMayor">
    <value>Click "Reveal" whenever you are ready to reveal yourself as the Mayor.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="Reveal">

  <string key="SpreadDust">
    <value>Would you like to spread the silver today, disabling the wolves tonight?</value>
  </string>
  <string key="BlacksmithSpreadSilver">
    <value>As the rest of the village debates over the events, they suddenly notice {0} wandering around spreading silver across the grounds. For now, at least, the village will be safe from wolf attacks. (Wolves are disabled tonight.)</value>

  <string key="PlayerBittenWolves">
    <value>As the wolves attack {0}, {1} stops everyone, being the Alpha Wolf. {1} tells the pack that {0} should join the pack instead of dying, so the pack leaves them to their infection. They will become a werewolf tomorrow night.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="PlayerBitten">
    <value>You were attacked by the wolves, but the Alpha Wolf chose you. Instead of being killed, you have been infected... and will become a wolf tomorrow night!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="BittenTurned">
    <value>As night falls, you feel a strange tingling, and your body aches as it begins to transform... You are now a werewolf!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutMayor">
    <value>As mayor, you are a lowly villager, until you reveal yourself. Then you are given twice the vote count for lynching (meaning that your vote is twice as powerful as everyone else's). Use that power wisely to help the Village Team.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutPrince">
    <value>The prince is a key role in the Village Team's strategy. Once the prince gets lynched, their role as Prince is revealed, and they survive. However, this can only happen once: if the village insists on lynching them, they will die.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSorcerer">
    <value>Do you remember the good old seer? Well now, it has its Wolf Team counterpart. The sorcerer is the Wuff's Seer. They can only see if someone is Wolf or Seer, and they win with the Wolves.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutClumsy">
    <value>You are the Clumsy Guy. Maybe you should not have had so much alcohol for breakfast. You can't see a damn thing. Can you even vote for the person you want to? (You have a 50% chance to vote for someone random.)</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutBlacksmith">
    <value>You are the BlackSmith. Through the years, no blades nor swords gave you as much satisfaction as the Silver Blades the elves ordered.\nYou might have some silverdust left. Who knows ? It might *prevent Wolves from eating tonight* 🤔</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutAlphaWolf">
    <value>You are the Alpha Wolf, the origin of the curse, the bane of banes. Every night, there's 20% chance that you will bite your pack's meal, and they will join your ranks instead of dying!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutWolfCub">
    <value>What a cuuuute little wuff. _tickles tickles_ -cough cough- As i was saying, you are the Wolf Cub and you _drops the mic_ -I just can't resist that. I think if anyone killed you, I'd give the wuffs two victims. You're too cute to die. I wouldn't be able to tickle you anymore-</value>

  <string key="CultConvertWolf">
    <value>The cult sends {0} to try to convert {1}, but instead {0}'s Head comes flying out of the Window... Wonder why they thought it was inedible! {0} is dead...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="HarlotFuckedKilledPublic">
    <value>{0} slips into {1}'s house, ready for a night of passion, only to find a mysterious stranger surgically removing {1}'s innards! The serial killer decides to satisfy {0} before adding a slutty heart to their collection!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="ApprenticeSeerEaten">
    <value>The villagers awake to find {0} hunched over a second-hand Ouija board while practising fortune-telling, with head missing. The Apprentice Seer is dead.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="BlacksmithKilled">
    <value>Seems like {0}, the resident blacksmith, must have been extremely unlucky. Five knives, fresh from {0}'s armory, were found plunged into their hands, feet and head, and pinned to the craftsman's table last night. Maybe the serial killer was hoping to expand their weapon collection alongside their organ one...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="CultistKilled">
    <value>{0} was found stabbed to death with a candlestick by their altar. The serial killer has struck again, regardless of race, language or religion! {0} was a Cultist.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="CupidKilled">
    <value>The next morning, the villagers were heartbroken to find {0} a.k.a. Cupid split from head to toe. Strangely the heart was missing...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="DrunkKilled">
    <value>The villagers had hoped to meet {0} to compliment their Martell, but all they found in {0}'s home was a broken knife and liver. All those years of drinking led to a liver so hard that even the Serial Killer probably does not fancy it...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="GuardianAngelKilled">
    <value>{0} would normally have managed to fight off the serial killer, but it was an irony that the Guardian Angel's halo has extinguished. {0} is dead.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="GunnerKilled">
    <value>Looks like {0} was caught napping last night! A gunshot was heard last night, but all there was was the remains of a gunner, with a bullet hole to the head and a stab to the torso. Clearly the serial killer has won.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="MayorKilled">
    <value>Assassination! {0} the mayor was found pinned with a knife on the table while working overnight at the mayor office! Clearly it's the serial killer exacting revenge for the asylum robbing them of years of their life!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="PrinceKilled">
    <value>Bells ring across the village before the sunrise, as armed guards flood the streets investigating the disappearance of Prince {0}. No clues were discovered, but it is suspected that there is a Serial Killer on the loose...</value>
    <value>{0}'s guards were caught napping last night. The royal remains of {0} were found, hung in various parts of the palace, having fallen prey to the knife. No amount of princely blood would deter a serial killer's blade.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="SeerKilled">
    <value>The villagers wake up to a rotting corpse of {0}, split from head to toe, stabs all over. Strangely the brain was carefully extricated, as if it was a premonition that the village has lost their top brains. {0} was the Seer.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="SorcererEaten">
    <value>The sound of mournful howls can be heard across the village. A mistake has been made. The wolves have killed one of their own. The Sorcerer {0} is dead.</value>
    <value>Cries of "I'm your ally!" were heard last night. All the villagers found next morning were an exhumed body and smashed mystical ball, belonging to {0}, the sorcerer. Hunger trumps comradeship...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="WildChildEaten">
    <value>NOMNOMNOMNOM! The wolves were heard last night, eating up a tender Wild Child, {0}, leaving behind only a reduced-size skeleton! The village wondered if the wolves felt any guilt tearing apart the defenceless child.</value>

    <value>The villagers wake up in the morning, only to find the severed body parts of {0}, the Cultist Hunter, in a cart placed in full view outside the town hall. Lesson learnt: don't visit the serial killer!</value>
    <value>The body of {0}, the Cultist Hunter, was found in the middle of town, albeit cut precisely into a hundred pieces. Checking if the Serial Killer was a cultist does not seem to be a good idea...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="CultConvertWolfPublic">
    <value>While it seemed that the wolves decided to stay good for once, punishing {0}, a cultist that decided to court trouble with the wolves, proved too difficult to resist. {0}'s head was converted to a fine supper, delivered to the wolves' doorsteps!</value>
    <value>The cult ran into unexpected trouble last night. Their newest member had the misfortune of visiting a wolf on the night the wolves decided to stay home, and the wolf found {0} quite delicious. Unfortunately for {0}, wolves have no interest in joining the new religious movement.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="CultConvertKillerPublic">
    <value>The cult thought they would have a new member in their ranks, but they were wrong! {0}, a cultist, was minced to pieces and placed at the town square in the morning! Strangely their "holy" book was found stabbed with a knife, as if a statement to show whose religion was triumphant.</value>
    <value>Last night, the cult tried to convert the one person in the village crazier than they are. Their newest member tried to convert the Serial Killer, and the Serial Killer made a new piece of art in the town square of {0}'s internal organs.</value>

  <string key="GAGuardedKiller">

  <string key="GAGuardedWolf">
    <value>{0} tried to guard a wolf last night. The town woke up to find only the wings of {0} hung on the church cross. Clearly the wolves had an extra meal god-sent, free-of-charge, to their homes.</value>

  <string key="HunterKillsWolfEnd">
    <value>Knowing only {0} was left, {1} tries to eat {0} up, but {0}'s military training and paranoia proves too much to handle! All there is left is a carcass with two shots to the torso and the last man standing: the victorious hunter for the village!</value>

  <string key="WolfKillsHunterEnd">
    <value>Knowing only {0} was left, {1} chose a time where {0}'s guard was at their lowest. Eliminating the final villager proved to be effortless for {1}, for all there remains is a mutiliated body of {0}, the hunter, adorned with parallel slashes to the face.</value>

  <string key="CHKillsCultistEnd">

    <value>As the sun starts to shine on the village, {0} wakes to the sound of silence. Realising there was no one left, {0} walks and walks, until they stand alone in the middle of the village. Looking at the sight of the corpses strewn all across the village, {0} sighs. Their lifelong dream of being chosen to be lynched by the villagers is as dead as the villagers are. They reach out and touch the rope, that had taken many lives, tenderly, before slipping it around their neck and letting themselves hang freely, with a sad smile on their face.</value>
    <value>{0} wakes up at dawn, alone. {0} sees how abject a failure they has been, not being able to get the village to satisfy their masochistic desires of being lynched to death. {0} grabs a rope and hangs himself, realising no one can accomplish their dream, since there is no one left.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="SorcererEnd">
    <value>{0} opens their eyes, but instead of hearing the usual bustle of the village, they are met with silence. They stare at the dreary ceiling, letting reality slowly sink in. Everyone was dead. The wolves were dead. With a pang in their heart, {0} gets up, and packs their things, before walking to the edge of the village. A tear slips from their eye, as {0} recalls how close they and their wolves were to victory. Alas, it was time to start a new life, with a new pack. {0} slips into the darkness of the forest, away from the quiet village.</value>
    <value>For all of {0}'s efforts, {0}'s wolf friends lay motionless and lifeless. Even if the wolves have been brought victory, there is no one to savour the success with, neither are there any living villagers to mock at. {0} peers into the crystal ball, and silently disappears, in a cloud of fog, in search of new wolves, new allies, and new treachery to commit new crimes against humanity.</value>

    <value>As you admired your liver collection one last time before leaving your house, a gust of wind blew in from the windows, frosting the glass jars... freezing you 🐺☃️.

    <value>You are the Grave Digger ☠️. Every night, you dig the graves for all the people who died since the last time you did (yes, even werewolves deserve a proper burial). Since you are out all night, wolves and the cult can't find you, unless you actually have nothing to do (i.e. no one died), in that case you'll just stay home. Everyone who visits you has a chance of falling into your newly dug graves, depending on how many graves you dug. Also, the chance is halved for everyone who is on the village team with you. But since you are out at night, the wolves or the serial killer might spot and kill you, and the more graves you have to dig, the more likely it is. Also, apparently the serial killer can find you whether you're at home or not, but they might at least stumble in one of your graves and hurt their leg, causing them to maybe lose control over who is their victim the next night...</value>

  <string key="CultFell">
    <value>You return from another tiring night, when suddenly you hear a scream from one of your unfinished graves! You hurry there, just to find {0} lying dead in an unfinished grave. What kind of cult tries to convert a grave digger, anyway?</value>

  <string key="CultConvertGraveDigger">
    <value>On your way to {1}'s house, {0} suddenly decides that it would be a good idea to burn down the church as well.
